//create mysql database called bamazon
//create a table inside of the database called products
    //the products should have

        // price (cost to customer)
        //stock_quanity
    //populate is database with around 10 different products
    //(i.e insert 'mock' data rows int this data base and table).
//create a file call bamazoncustomer.js
    //running this application will first display all of the items
    //includes the ids, names, produts, and prices of products for sale.
//the app should prompt users with two messages.
    //the first prompt should ask them for the id of the product they would like to purchase
    //the second message should ask how many units of the products they would like to buy
//once the customer has placed the rder, your applucatuon should check if your store has enough of the products for the customer's request.
